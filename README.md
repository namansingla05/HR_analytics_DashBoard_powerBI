## Data Insights & Suggestions

1. **Departmental Focus**:
   - The R&D department has the highest attrition (61%). Deeper analysis or engagement strategies may be required.

2. **Age Group Observations**:
   - Most employees fall in the 25â€“34 age band, which also has notable attrition. Retention programs targeting this group could be impactful.

3. **Gender Diversity**:
   - Attrition varies by gender across age groups, with some bands showing 100% attrition for one gender. Gender-specific interventions might help balance retention.

4. **Education Field Influence**:
   - Employees with Medical and Life Sciences backgrounds show higher attrition. It may help to reassess hiring or support strategies for these fields.
